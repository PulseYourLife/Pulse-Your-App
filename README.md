## Funciones Principales

> WIP 

## Our Purpose
We want to give an opportunity to all those who suffer cardiac problems to be comfortable and not to be afraid of 
suffering to heart attack, we propose to mobile application that shows real time stadistics and analytics about heart 
rate, if the user presents an irregular heartbeat we propose some physical activities to regulate it according to the 
heartbeat level, also if the user suffers to cardiac arrest we'll call an emergency ambulance and send a message to 
their trusted people selected by the user with the current user location.
